When you enable the Linear integration, Highlight will allow creating Issues from the session replay and errors viewer. Track bugs or enhancements for your app as you triage frontend and backend errors or watch your users' replays.

To get started, go to <https://app.highlight.run/integrations> and click the "Connect" button in the Linear section.

## Features

1.  [Comments](docId\:KUJjzlZW3FgFGRdLZk-QZ) can create a Linear issue filled out with the body of the comment and link back to the Session.

2.  [Grouping Errors](docId\:nsklovPV2zpwXld8rW_8l) shows a shortcut to creating a Linear issue pre-populated with the Error stack trace and linking to the full context of how the error occurred.
