If your company has strict security/data access requirements, you have the follow options for deploying Highlight on-prem:

[AWS Deployment](/on-premises/deployment-overview/aws-deployment)
We have a step-by-step guide for deploying Highlight on a single EC2 instance, seen [here](https://docs2.highlight.run/aws-deployment).

We have a step-by-step guide for deploying Highlight on Heroku, seen [here](https://docs2.highlight.run/heroku-deployment).

### Custom Deployment

&#x20;If you'd like to deploy using a custom method (with common large-scale deployment tooling, for example), we're happy to help out with the process. Contact sales\@highlight.run with more information regarding your schedule and we'll be in touch.

## Deploy Keys!

Don't forget to email sales\@highlight.run for your deploy key, otherwise on-prem Highlight won't run!
