## Why deploy on-prem?

If your company is restrictive regarding what data can enter/leave your VPC, the easiest solution may be to deploy Highlight within it! That's why we built the on-prem version of Highlight. This 10-minute guide will help you set up an on-premises version of Highlight.
Alternatively, if you're looking to get started with Highlight's SaaS product without worrying about installing software manually, make an account at [app.highlight.run](https://app.highlight.run/).

## How do I get started?

Before starting, make sure to contact sales\@highlight.run for a deployment key. The Highlight team can also step you through the process below!

## How does it work?

A docker container with an encrypted binary can be found in our public Github repo [here](https://github.com/highlight-run/highlight-onpremise). Using this, we have first-class support for running heroku on docker-compose with a setup guide for AWS.
