By default, only members in your Highlight workspace will be able to view sessions (see [Team Management](/product-features/team-management)). If you'd like to share one-off sessions and don't want to invite folks to your workspace, then you can share individual sessions.

To share a session, click the share button then toggle "Allow anyone with the link to access this session.".

To unshare a session, untoggle the "Allow anyone with the link to access this sessions.".

## What is shared?

1.  Console messages
