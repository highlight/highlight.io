Highlight is able to record websites that use WebGL.

:::hint
Highlight's WebGL recording is currently in beta. We are actively working on making this production ready. If you have any questions please reach out to us at support\@highlight.run

## Getting Started

Recording WebGL is disabled by default. To enable WebGL recording, enable canvas recording by following the instructions for [Canvas](docId:-46LfreM66BCi4uP1BkB2) recording.

## Caveats

*   [Privacy](docId\:Nwmpmz7WSlvHP61e3RQSd) controls do not apply to WebGL right now
