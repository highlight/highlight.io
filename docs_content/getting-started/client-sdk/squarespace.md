## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Let's get you up and running with Highlight. **We should be done in less than 2 minutes.**

## Adding the Snippet

Add the snippet to your `index.html`.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/highlight.run"></script>
        <script>
            window.H.init("<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>") // Get your project ID from https://app.highlight.run/setup
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Your Application -->
    </body>
</html>
```

## Verify

Start your app, go to it in the browser, then click around. Highlight will be recording your session and it will show up on <https://app.highlight.run/sessions> a few seconds after recording has started.
