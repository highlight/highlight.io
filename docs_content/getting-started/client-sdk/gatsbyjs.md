## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Let's get you up and running with Highlight. **We should be done in less than 2 minutes.**

## Installing the SDK

Install `@highlight-run/gatsby-plugin-highlight` using your package manager.

```codeblocktabs
```none
npm install @highlight-run/gatsby-plugin-highlight
```

```shell
yarn add @highlight-run/gatsby-plugin-highlight
```
```

## Register Highlight as a Gatsby Plugin

You will need to register the Highlight Gatsby Plugin.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@highlight-run/gatsby-plugin-highlight",
      options: {
        orgID: "<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>" // Get your project ID from https://app.highlight.run/setup
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

## Verify

Start your app, go to it in the browser, then click around. Highlight will be recording your session and it will show up on <https://app.highlight.run/sessions> a few seconds after recording has started.
