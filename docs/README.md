## Official Documentation Repo for Highlight (https://highlight.io)
Welcome to the repo housing the Documentation for [highlight.io](https://highlight.io). This repo contains all of the copy that lives on our main docs site (https://highlight.io/docs)

## What's Highlight? / Getting Started
Highlight gives you fullstack visibility by pairing frontend monitoring tooling (session replay, console contents, network requests) with more traditional server-side monitoring (error monitoring, etc..). To setup Highlight in your web app, the relevant documentation can be found at https://highlight.io/docs and on your highlight dashboard at https://app.highlight.io.
