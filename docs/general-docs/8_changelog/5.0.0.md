-   Pins highlight.run dynamic client version to the highlight.run package version.

# Upgrading from 4.x or older

-   We've migrated our lazy-loaded bundled to be served from static.highlight.io instead of static.highlight.run. As a result, if you use custom [Content-Security-Policy CSP](/tips/content-security-policy), change references form static.highlight.run to static.highlight.io.
-   There are no breaking API / package behavior changes with this release.
