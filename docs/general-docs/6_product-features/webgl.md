Highlight is able to record websites that use WebGL.

```hint
Highlight's WebGL recording is currently in beta. We are actively working on making this production ready. If you have any questions please reach out to us at support\@highlight.run
```

## Getting Started

Recording WebGL is disabled by default. To enable WebGL recording, enable canvas recording by following the instructions for [Canvas](/product-features/canvas) recording.

## Caveats

-   [Privacy](/session-replay/privacy) controls do not apply to WebGL right now
