# Our Mission
Our mission is to give you the tools you need to **uncover, resolve, and prevent** issues in your web app.

# Our Values
## We build in public.
We strive to build in public in every way we can. This means sharing our roadmap, product specs, and company strategy. We see this as giving you all the more reason to consider joining us in [building highlight](careers.highlight.run).

## We build with cohesion.
People may think that we're building multiple products (session replay, error monitoring, etc..). But we see it as one. Before we build anything new, we prioritize making it operate seemlessly with everything else.

## We build for today's developer.
What are the needs of today's developers? E.g. if you're building software, why should you care about grafana or loki or the elk stack? Highlight is built for developers that want to **develop**. Leave the monitoring stuff to us üëç.
