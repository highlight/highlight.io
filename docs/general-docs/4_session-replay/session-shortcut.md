The session shortcut allows you to set a keyboard shortcut in your app/website that will open the current session in Highlight. You can enable session shortcut and the keyboard shortcut by setting `sessionShortcut` in [H.init()](/sdk/client#Hinit).

Scenarios of when you're using your app:

1.  Want to call out a bug without having to figure out what the repro steps are

2.  Want to call out a design change for a specific user scenario without having to type out all the context

For example, if you set `Ctrl` + `0` as the session shortcut, pressing `Ctrl` + `0` while in your app will open Highlight in a new tab with the session you were on loaded. Once you're in Highlight, you can:

1.  Share the session (See [Session Sharing](/session-replay/session-sharing))

2.  Create a comment and tag the directly responsible person (See [Comments](/product-features/comments))
