Let's get you up and running with Highlight. You should be done and able to see a recorded session **within 2 minutes!**
## For your client / frontend:

A session in Highlight starts in the client. 

Highlight supports any framework that uses the [dom](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp) under the hood, and we support all modern browsers to date. Beyond that, to make integration even easier, we have official support for the following frameworks:

-   [React.js](/getting-started/client-sdk/reactjs)

-   [Next.js](/getting-started/client-sdk/nextjs)

-   [Vue.js](/getting-started/client-sdk/vuejs)

-   [Gatsby.js](/getting-started/client-sdk/gatsbyjs)

-   [HTML](/getting-started/client-sdk/html)

-   [SvelteKit](/getting-started/client-sdk/sveltekit)

-   [Angular](/getting-started/client-sdk/angular)

-   If you don't see your framework above, see our docs for [other frameworks](/getting-started/client-sdk/other).

For in-depth instructions, follow the [Client SDK](/getting-started/client-sdk) guide.

## For your backend / server:

Highlight also supports reporting errors from your backend and mapping these to corresponding sessions. This gives you and your team a full picture of your application.
