```hint
Reference our [client-side sdk docs](/docs/sdk/client) for advanced functionality and our [fullstack mapping guide](/docs/getting-started/frontend-backend-mapping) on pairing backend errors with your replay.
```
## Installing the SDK

Install `highlight.run` using your package manager.

```shell
# with npm
npm install highlight.run

# with yarn
yarn add highlight.run
```

## Initialize

Initialize Highlight where your application starts, likely in the Angular `main.ts` file.

```typescript
import { H } from 'highlight.run';

H.init(
    "<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>", // Get your project ID from https://app.highlight.run/setup
    networkRecording: {
        enabled: true,
        recordHeadersAndBody: true,
    },
    tracingOrigins: true // Optional configuration of Highlight features
);
```

Check out [H.init()](/sdk/client#Hinit) docs for more details about the options to configure.

If you prefer a full-fledged example, you can also reference our sample [Angular Repo with Highlight Configured](https://github.com/highlight-run/example-angular).

## Verify

Start your app, go to it in the browser, then click around. Highlight will be recording your session and it will show up on <https://app.highlight.run/sessions> a few seconds after recording has started.

## Configuration

Integration with [Angular ErrorHandler](https://angular.io/api/core/ErrorHandler) coming soon!

## Next Steps

After installing Highlight for your frontend application, there are a few other things you should check out about our Session Replay product, namely:
