## On Vercel

If you are running your Next.js app in [Vercel](https://vercel.app/), you can install [our integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/highlight) to automatically inject the `HIGHLIGHT_SOURCEMAP_UPLOAD_API_KEY` environment variable. Add it to your project and configure it from the link above to inject the necessary environment variables.

## Other Cloud Providers

Start your app, go to it in the browser, then click around. Highlight will be recording your session and it will show up on [app.highlight.io/sessions](https://app.highlight/sessions) a few seconds after recording has started.
