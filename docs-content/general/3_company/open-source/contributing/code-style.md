# Code Style

While we don't fret about whether you prefer tabs or spaces, we want our code to be easy to read and add to. Style preferences are codified and automated as part of CI and automated development workflows (such as `husky` and gomod configurations). If you have ideas on how to improve our style linting, open a PR and let us know!
