## Best first issues to take on

It's best to start with issues marked as ["good first issue"](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). We mark these issues based on how well-defined and testable they are. If you're interested in a larger project, adding support for new programming languages via a new SDK would always greatly appreciated. If there is a feature you're missing in Highlight, reach out on our [discussions](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/discussions) or on our [discord](https://highlight.io/community) to get a conversation started about the best implementation.

## How do I develop?

You'll want to spin up Highlight locally to get to developing. The best way to do this is by using docker. Check out [the self-hosting instructions](../self-host-hobby.md) for more info.
