# Adding an SDK

## OpenTelemetry

The highlight.io SDKs are powered by [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) under the hood, and therefore report data to our deployed opentelemetry collector (at https://otel.highlight.io). For a better understanding of the architecture, take a look at the [architecture page](architecture.md) for a diagram of how data is sent to the collector and the public graph.
