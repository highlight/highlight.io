[highlight.io](https://highlight.io) has first-party support for enhancing minified stacktraces in javascript. We also support the ability to send us sourcemaps in the case that they aren't public. Read more about it in our [getting started doc](../../../getting-started/3_client-sdk/7_replay-configuration/sourcemaps.md)
