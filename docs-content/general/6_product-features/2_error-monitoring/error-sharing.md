By default, only members in your Highlight workspace will be able to view errors (see [Team Management](../3_general-features/team-management.md)). If you'd like to share one-off errors and don't want to invite folks to your workspace, then you can share individual errors.

To share an error, click the share button and then toggle "Allow anyone with the link to view this error".

Untoggling this button removes public access to the error.

## What is shared?

When you share an error, all details about the error are made public. This includes user metadata and stack traces for each error instance.
