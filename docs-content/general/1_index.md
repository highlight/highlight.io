## What's Highlight?

Highlight is a tool that helps teams reproduce end-to-end user sessions to better understand their application.

With Highlight, **engineering teams** can replay errors with high precision, which includes a complete session replay, outgoing network requests, dense stack traces and insight into the app's state management system (redux, apollo's cache, etc.). At the same time, **product teams** can analyze user activity, collaborate with engineering teams and find the reason for user drop offs to gain insight into UX.
