[highlight.io](https://highlight.io) is monitoring software for the next generation of developers. Our goal is to build a cohesive and fully-featured monitoring solution, something we wished WE had. And it's all open source :).

## What are you building?

Our goal is to build the ultime monitoring toolkit for early-stage engineering teams. That being said, we have to start somewhere right? In the short term, we have immediate plans to build/maintain the following products:

<DocsCardGroup>
    <DocsCard title="UX Monitoring." href="./">
        {"Session replay and frontend monitoring."}
    </DocsCard>
    <DocsCard title="Error Monitoring." href="./6_product-features/comments.md">
        {"good evening."}
    </DocsCard>
</DocsCardGroup>



With Highlight, **engineering teams** can replay errors with high precision, which includes a complete session replay, outgoing network requests, dense stack traces and insight into the app's state management system (redux, apollo's cache, etc.). At the same time, **product teams** can analyze user activity, collaborate with engineering teams and find the reason for user drop offs to gain insight into UX.
