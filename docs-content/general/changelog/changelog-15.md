## Added a "goto" button on each devtools resource.

These past few weeks, we got feedback from our [discord](https://highlight.io/community) members that being able to directly click "goto" on an error, network request, or log would be valuable. We just shipped that!

## Slack alerts link to a specific instance.

Slack alerts normally linked to the error group, but didn't link to the specific instance. We now link to the exact instance of an error that way you click into the relevant session.
